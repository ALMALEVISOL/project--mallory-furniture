          ABOUT THIS COMPANY, PERODNAME RICHARD, me faltaron muchas cosas Sales
          and Refund Policy Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact
          that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make
          sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring,
          evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple
          Online Store, in an Apple Retail Store, or on the phone with the Apple
          Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer
          to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.) As with any
          shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to
          transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys
          will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or
          making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth
          below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy (Opens in a new window) and
          Terms of Use(Opens in a new window). Standard Return Policy We
          fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you
          purchase from the Apple Store. That’s because we go out of our way to
          ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We
          understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you
          expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the
          following terms related to returning a product. For any undamaged
          product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging
          along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) within 14 days of
          the date you receive the product, and we’ll exchange it or offer a
          refund based upon the original payment method. In addition, please
          note the following: Products can be returned only in the country or
          region in which they were originally purchased. The following products
          are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads,
          subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program, Apple Store Gift
          Cards, and any Apple Developer Connection products. For returns to an
          Apple Retail Store for cash, cash equivalent, and check transactions
          over $750, Apple will mail a refund check to you within 10 business
          days. Should you wish to return ten or more of the same product, you
          must return to the Apple Store where originally purchased. In the case
          of items returned with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple
          Gift Card. Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal
          with the software license on the outside of the package and you could
          read the software license before opening its packaging. As an
          exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree
          to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use
          any copies of returned software. Apple provides security features to
          enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If these
          features have been activated and cannot be disabled by the person in
          possession of the phone, Apple may refuse the return or exchange. For
          complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple
          Store please visit the Returns & Refunds (Opens in a new window) page.

          that you will lose your Upgrade Option as set forth under the terms of
          the iPhone Upgrade Program(Opens in a new window). iPhone, iPad and
          Watch Returns - Wireless Service Cancellation Wireless carriers have
